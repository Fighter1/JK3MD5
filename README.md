# JK3MD5

JK3MD5 is a program used to check if your JKA's assets, .exe's, etc have been modified. To do this, it checks the MD5 hash values of your files and compares them to the hash values of unmodified JK3 files. If your MD5 hash value is different, then your files are modified.

This can be used to track down problems with corrupt files, experiments you did, etc.

This program was made for Caelum in JKH's Secret Santa 2012. I asked for his permission to upload it and update it in the future, and he gave me it.
